/**
 * UI Component Index
 * 
 * This file centralizes exports for all reusable UI components.
 * Using this pattern allows for cleaner imports across the application.
 */

// Basic UI components will be added here as they're created
// For example:
// export { default as Button } from './Button';
// export { default as Card } from './Card';
// export { default as Input } from './Input';

// Temporarily export a type or constant to make this a proper module
export type UIComponentNames = 'Button' | 'Card' | 'Input' | 'Badge' | 'Alert';

// Export placeholder for future components
export const UI_VERSION = '0.1.0';

// This file will be expanded as more UI components are developed
