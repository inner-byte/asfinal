# Project Goals

## Introduction

The AI-powered subtitle generator web application is designed to provide accurate and real-time subtitle generation for videos, enhancing accessibility and user engagement within a workplace environment. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Gemini-flash-2.0 model via the Vertex API, the application aims to deliver high-precision subtitles with precise timestamps. Integrated with the Plyr video player, users will experience seamless real-time subtitle previews, ensuring an intuitive and efficient workflow. This project prioritizes performance, usability, and future scalability while adhering to modern UI/UX standards. Ultimately, this project seeks to set a standard for AI-driven accessibility tools within the workplace, ensuring all users can effectively engage with video content.

## Primary Objectives

- Develop a robust web application that enables users to upload videos and generate subtitles using the Gemini-flash-2.0 AI model.
- Provide a real-time subtitle preview feature during video playback to enhance user interaction and validation.
- Enable users to export generated subtitles in multiple formats (SRT, VTT, ASS) for versatile use cases.
- Ensure high accuracy in subtitle timestamps, meeting precision requirements of ±0.1 to ±3 seconds.
- Optimize application performance to efficiently handle large video files (up to 4GB) using Redis for task management.
- Design a modern, intuitive user interface inspired by the "lipsync-2" design, enhanced with contemporary aesthetics and usability features.

## Functional Requirements

- **Video Upload and Storage**:  
  - Support uploading videos up to 4GB in size.  
  - Integrate with Appwrite Bucket Storage for secure and scalable video storage.

- **Subtitle Generation**:  
  - Utilize the Gemini-flash-2.0 model via the Vertex API to generate subtitles with precise timestamps.  
  - Generate subtitles in VTT format for internal use with the Plyr video player (VTT is widely supported for web-based players).

- **Real-time Subtitle Preview**:  
  - Integrate the Plyr video player to display subtitles in real-time during playback.  
  - Use Plyr’s `cuechange` event to dynamically monitor and adjust subtitle synchronization.

- **Subtitle Export**:  
  - Offer export options for subtitles in SRT, VTT, and ASS formats to accommodate various use cases.  
  - Implement on-demand conversion from the internal VTT format to the selected export format using tools like FFmpeg or custom scripts.

- **Timestamp Synchronization**:  
  - Employ FFmpeg-based alignment tools to correct timestamp discrepancies beyond the acceptable tolerance.  
  - Achieve a minimum timestamp accuracy of ±0.1 seconds for high-precision scenarios, with a maximum tolerance of ±3 seconds.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  
  - Efficiently manage large video files and processing tasks using Redis for background job queue optimization.  
  - Ensure responsive application behavior, even during resource-intensive operations.

- **Usability**:  
  - Design an intuitive, modern user interface inspired by the "lipsync-2" concept, featuring a dark gray base, gradient accents, and improved typography (e.g., Inter or Poppins fonts).  
  - Include interactive elements like animated transitions, glowing drop zones for uploads, and progress indicators for a polished user experience.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Architect the application to support future enhancements, such as live subtitle generation, without necessitating significant redevelopment.

- **Reliability**:  
  - Maintain consistent subtitle accuracy and application stability through rigorous testing and error handling.  
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for timestamp correction to ensure synchronization reliability.

## Constraints and Considerations

- **User Scope**:  
  - Intended for closed workplace use; no user authentication or management is required.

- **Video Handling**:  
  - Support for videos up to 4GB requires optimized upload and processing strategies to avoid performance bottlenecks.

- **Timestamp Accuracy**:  
  - Must meet strict precision requirements (±0.1 to ±3 seconds), with adjustment mechanisms in place as needed.

- **Technology Stack**:  
  - **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS (v4).  
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express.  
  - **Database and Storage**: Appwrite Database and Bucket Storage.  
  - **Task Management**: Redis (likely with BullMQ) for processing optimization.  
  - **Video Player**: Plyr with VTT subtitle support.

- **Future Integration**:  
  - The architecture must accommodate potential future features, such as live subtitle generation using the Gemini Live API, in a subsequent phase.
