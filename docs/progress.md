### Recently Completed Tasks
- Created `abs-ui` and `abs-server` repositories with initial Next.js and Express projects
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS v4
- Initialized Express project with TypeScript
- Set up backend project structure according to `project_structure_rules.md`
- Configured middleware for error handling, validation, and logging
- Set up basic API endpoints structure for video upload functionality
- Created Appwrite configuration for database and storage
- Set up Appwrite project with database and storage buckets
- Created database collections for videos and subtitles with proper attributes
- Configured storage buckets for video and subtitle files with appropriate security settings

- Implement frontend components for video upload (DragDrop.tsx, ProgressBar.tsx)

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Complete frontend structure with placeholder components
2. Implement `useVideoUpload` hook for handling uploads
3. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
4. Implement video processing and validation

### Challenges and Solutions

| Date | Challenge | Solution | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript errors with Express error handler middleware | Modified the error handler to use proper Express ErrorRequestHandler type with void return type | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Appwrite database methods called with incorrect number of arguments | Added database ID parameter to all database calls (createDocument, getDocument, listDocuments) | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error with cors module declaration | Created custom type declaration for cors module | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Handling large video file uploads (up to 4GB) efficiently | Implemented streaming approach with temporary file storage and cleaned up after upload | Resolved |

### Implementation Notes

#### Research Findings
- **Package Versions**:
  - Next.js: Version 15 (compatible with React 19)
  - Node.js: Latest stable version
  - Express: Version 5.1.0 (recently released as default on npm)
  - TypeScript: Version 5.8.3
  - TailwindCSS: Version 4.0 (as specified in requirements)
  - Plyr: Latest version with confirmed WebVTT subtitle support
  - FFmpeg: Pending research
  - Bull (Redis queue): Pending research
  - Multer: Latest version for handling file uploads

- **API Documentation**:
  - Gemini-flash-2.0 via Vertex API: Pending research
  - Appwrite: Version 1.6.1 (as of February 2025)

#### Technical Decisions
- Structured the backend as MVC-inspired pattern with controllers, services, and routes
- Used Appwrite for both database and storage operations
- Implemented proper error handling middleware for Express
- Created typed interfaces for videos and subtitles to ensure type safety
- Chose multer for handling file uploads with 4GB file size limit
- Implemented temporary file storage with cleanup to handle large uploads efficiently

### Next Steps
1. Complete the frontend structure with components for video upload
2. Implement the video upload functionality in the frontend
3. Research and implement the Gemini-flash-2.0 integration via Vertex API
4. Connect frontend and backend for the complete video upload workflow
5. Implement testing for the video upload feature

### Blockers
- Vertex API access needs to be set up for Gemini-flash-2.0 integration
