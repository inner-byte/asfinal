### Recently Completed Tasks
- Created `abs-ui` and `abs-server` repositories with initial Next.js and Express projects
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS v4
- Initialized Express project with TypeScript
- Set up backend project structure according to `project_structure_rules.md`
- Configured middleware for error handling, validation, and logging
- Set up basic API endpoints structure for video upload functionality
- Created Appwrite configuration for database and storage
- Set up Appwrite project with database and storage buckets
- Created database collections for videos and subtitles with proper attributes
- Configured storage buckets for video and subtitle files with appropriate security settings
- Implemented backend API endpoints for video upload, streaming, and deletion
- Added file upload handling functionality with multer middleware
- Set up frontend project structure according to `project_structure_rules.md`
- Created basic layout with placeholder components following the "lipsync-2" design
- Extracted placeholder components into proper modular component files:
  - VideoUpload.tsx - For video file uploads with drag and drop support
  - SubtitlePreview.tsx - For displaying video with generated subtitles
  - ExportOptions.tsx - For subtitle format selection and downloading

### In-Progress Tasks
- Configure ESLint and Prettier in both repositories
- Implement frontend components for video upload (DragDrop.tsx, ProgressBar.tsx)
- Implement basic routing using Next.js App Router

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Implement `useVideoUpload` hook for handling uploads
2. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
3. Implement video processing and validation
4. Integrate Plyr video player with basic subtitle support

### Challenges and Solutions

| Date | Challenge | Solution | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript errors with Express error handler middleware | Modified the error handler to use proper Express ErrorRequestHandler type with void return type | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Appwrite database methods called with incorrect number of arguments | Added database ID parameter to all database calls (createDocument, getDocument, listDocuments) | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error with cors module declaration | Created custom type declaration for cors module | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Handling large video file uploads (up to 4GB) efficiently | Implemented streaming approach with temporary file storage and cleaned up after upload | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Creating UI components that match the "lipsync-2" design reference | Implemented a modern UI with dark theme, gradient accents, and subtle animations following the design system | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error in components index.ts | Fixed UI/index.ts to properly export a type and constant to make it a valid module | Resolved |

### Implementation Notes

#### Research Findings
- **Package Versions**:
  - Next.js: Version 15 (compatible with React 19)
  - Node.js: Latest stable version
  - Express: Version 5.1.0 (recently released as default on npm)
  - TypeScript: Version 5.8.3
  - TailwindCSS: Version 4.0 (as specified in requirements)
  - Plyr: Latest version with confirmed WebVTT subtitle support
  - FFmpeg: Pending research
  - Bull (Redis queue): Pending research
  - Multer: Latest version for handling file uploads

- **API Documentation**:
  - Gemini-flash-2.0 via Vertex API: Pending research
  - Appwrite: Version 1.6.1 (as of February 2025)

#### Technical Decisions
- Structured the backend as MVC-inspired pattern with controllers, services, and routes
- Used Appwrite for both database and storage operations
- Implemented proper error handling middleware for Express
- Created typed interfaces for videos and subtitles to ensure type safety
- Chose multer for handling file uploads with 4GB file size limit
- Implemented temporary file storage with cleanup to handle large uploads efficiently
- Created modern UI following the "lipsync-2" design with custom animations and gradient elements
- Used Inter and Poppins fonts as specified in the project goals
- Organized components using feature-based architecture for better maintainability:
  - Each feature has its own directory (VideoUpload, SubtitlePreview, Export)
  - Created index.ts files for clean exports and imports

### Next Steps
1. Implement `useVideoUpload` hook for handling uploads
2. Create the DragDrop and ProgressBar components for the video upload feature
3. Connect frontend components to their corresponding backend API endpoints
4. Research and implement the Gemini-flash-2.0 integration via Vertex API
5. Begin implementation of the Plyr video player integration

### Blockers
- Vertex API access needs to be set up for Gemini-flash-2.0 integration
