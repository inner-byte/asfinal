  - Created route structure for main features (video-upload, subtitle-preview, export)
  - Developed a NavigationContext for managing workflow state across routes
  - Implemented a reusable StepNavigation component for consistent user flow
  - Connected components to navigation system for state management
  - Added proper page transitions and navigation controls

### In-Progress Tasks
- Add frontend-backend integration tests for upload workflow

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Research and implement the Gemini-flash-2.0 integration via Vertex API
2. Integrate Plyr video player with basic subtitle support
3. Begin implementation of the subtitle preview functionality

### Challenges and Solutions

| Date | Challenge | Solution | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript errors with Express error handler middleware | Modified the error handler to use proper Express ErrorRequestHandler type with void return type | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Appwrite database methods called with incorrect number of arguments | Added database ID parameter to all database calls (createDocument, getDocument, listDocuments) | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error with cors module declaration | Created custom type declaration for cors module | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Handling large video file uploads (up to 4GB) efficiently | Implemented streaming approach with temporary file storage and cleaned up after upload | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Creating UI components that match the "lipsync-2" design reference | Implemented a modern UI with dark theme, gradient accents, and subtle animations following the design system | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error in components index.ts | Fixed UI/index.ts to properly export a type and constant to make it a valid module | Resolved |

### Implementation Notes

#### Research Findings
- **Package Versions**:
  - Next.js: Version 15 (compatible with React 19)
  - Node.js: Latest stable version
  - Express: Version 5.1.0 (recently released as default on npm)
  - TypeScript: Version 5.8.3
  - TailwindCSS: Version 4.0 (as specified in requirements)
  - Plyr: Latest version with confirmed WebVTT subtitle support
  - FFmpeg: Pending research
  - Bull (Redis queue): Pending research
  - Multer: Latest version for handling file uploads

- **API Documentation**:
  - Gemini-flash-2.0 via Vertex API: Pending research
  - Appwrite: Version 1.6.1 (as of February 2025)

#### Technical Decisions
- Structured the backend as MVC-inspired pattern with controllers, services, and routes
- Used Appwrite for both database and storage operations
- Implemented proper error handling middleware for Express
- Created typed interfaces for videos and subtitles to ensure type safety
- Chose multer for handling file uploads with 4GB file size limit
- Implemented temporary file storage with cleanup to handle large uploads efficiently
- Created modern UI following the "lipsync-2" design with custom animations and gradient elements
- Used Inter and Poppins fonts as specified in the project goals
- Organized components using feature-based architecture for better maintainability:
  - Each feature has its own directory (VideoUpload, SubtitlePreview, Export)
  - Created index.ts files for clean exports and imports

### Next Steps
1. Complete the frontend components for video upload (add any necessary refinements to DragDrop.tsx and ProgressBar.tsx)
2. Research and implement the Gemini-flash-2.0 integration via Vertex API
3. Begin implementation of the Plyr video player integration for subtitle preview
4. Develop the subtitle generation service with the Vertex API for Gemini-flash-2.0

### Blockers
- Vertex API access needs to be set up for Gemini-flash-2.0 integration
