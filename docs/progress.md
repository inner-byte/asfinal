### Upcoming Tasks
1.  Complete Plyr integration and connect VTT fetching on the frontend preview page.
2.  Begin Phase 2: Implement `useSubtitleSync` hook and research FFmpeg timestamp correction methods.
3.  Implement subtitle preview and synchronization features.

### Challenges and Solutions

| Date | Challenge | Solution | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript errors with Express error handler middleware | Modified the error handler to use proper Express ErrorRequestHandler type with void return type | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Appwrite database methods called with incorrect number of arguments | Added database ID parameter to all database calls (createDocument, getDocument, listDocuments) | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error with cors module declaration | Created custom type declaration for cors module | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | Handling large video file uploads (up to 4GB) efficiently | Implemented streaming approach for initial upload to Appwrite. *Further streaming needed for processing pipeline.* | Resolved (Initial Upload) |
| April 12, 2025 | Creating UI components that match the "lipsync-2" design reference | Implemented a modern UI with dark theme, gradient accents, and subtle animations following the design system | Resolved |
| April 12, 2025 | TypeScript error in components index.ts | Fixed UI/index.ts to properly export a type and constant to make it a valid module | Resolved |
| April 13, 2025 | Gemini API limitations for large audio files | Adopted intermediate GCS storage approach: Upload extracted audio to a backend-managed GCS bucket and pass the `gs://` URI to Gemini. Added cleanup steps. | Resolved |
| April 15, 2025 | Appwrite SDK returning ArrayBuffer instead of URL string | Fixed by constructing direct URLs to Appwrite storage instead of using `storage.getFileDownload()` which was returning an object that couldn't be properly converted to a URL string. | Resolved |

### Implementation Notes

#### Research Findings
- **Package Versions**:
  - Next.js: Version 15 (compatible with React 19)
  - Node.js: Latest stable version
  - Express: Version 5.1.0
  - TypeScript: Version 5.8.3
  - TailwindCSS: Version 4.0
  - Plyr: Latest version with confirmed WebVTT subtitle support
  - **`fluent-ffmpeg`**: Latest stable version (Node.js wrapper for FFmpeg binary) - *Selected for audio extraction*
  - **Background Job Queue**: BullMQ (Redis-backed) - *Selected for Phase 5*
  - Multer: Latest version (May be less relevant if uploads go directly to Appwrite first)
  - **Google Cloud Vertex AI**: Latest stable SDK (`@google-cloud/vertexai`)
  - **Google Cloud Storage**: Latest stable SDK (`@google-cloud/storage`) - *Required for intermediate audio*
  - **`async-retry`**: Latest stable version - *Selected for Gemini API calls*
  - **Gemini-flash-2.0 Model**: Available through Vertex AI as 'gemini-2.0-flash'

- **API Documentation**:
  - Gemini-flash-2.0 via Vertex API: Reviewed for integration planning.
  - Appwrite: Version 1.6.1 (as of February 2025)

#### Technical Decisions
- Structured the backend as MVC-inspired pattern with controllers, services, and routes.
- Used Appwrite for primary database and storage operations (videos, final VTTs).
- Implemented proper error handling middleware for Express (`AppError` class).
- Created typed interfaces for videos and subtitles to ensure type safety.
- Implemented streaming for initial video upload to Appwrite.
- Created modern UI following the "lipsync-2" design with custom animations and gradient elements.
- Used Inter and Poppins fonts as specified in the project goals.
- Organized components using feature-based architecture for better maintainability.
- **Implemented Pipeline:** Appwrite Stream -> `fluent-ffmpeg` -> Temp Local Audio -> Backend GCS -> Gemini API -> Appwrite VTT Storage -> Appwrite DB.
- Used `async-retry` for reliable Gemini API calls.
- Implemented robust VTT formatting.
- **Planned (Phase 5):** Implement Redis/BullMQ for background job queue management for long-running tasks like subtitle generation.

### Next Steps
1.  Complete the frontend integration for the subtitle preview page (Plyr player, fetching data).
2.  Begin Phase 2 tasks once M1.4 is complete.
3.  Implement subtitle preview and synchronization features.

### Blockers
- None at this time - Ready to complete the frontend integration and move to Phase 2.

## Development Log

### [DATE: April 15, 2025]

#### Summary
Fixed critical issue with Appwrite URL handling for video downloads. The Appwrite SDK's `storage.getFileDownload()` function was returning an object (likely an ArrayBuffer) instead of a URL string, causing the subtitle generation pipeline to fail.

#### Details
- Fixed `getVideoDownloadUrl` in `videoService.ts` to construct the URL directly using the Appwrite endpoint and file ID instead of using `storage.getFileDownload()`.
- Updated `getVideoStream` in `videoService.ts` to use the same approach for consistency.
- Modified `prepareVideoForProcessing` in `videoProcessingUtils.ts` to correctly handle the URL format.
- Updated documentation (`tasks.md`, `progress.md`) to mark the Gemini integration tasks as completed.

### [DATE: April 13, 2025]

#### Summary
Completed initial setup, video upload functionality, and frontend structure. Defined the detailed implementation plan for Gemini integration (`#file:gemini_transcription_implementation.md`). Adjusted task and progress tracking to reflect that this detailed Gemini pipeline is the next major implementation step for Milestone M1.3.

#### Details
- Confirmed completion of M1.1 and M1.2.
- Updated documentation (`tasks.md`, `progress.md`) to accurately reflect the pending status of the detailed Gemini integration pipeline (audio extraction, GCS, API calls, VTT formatting) as the primary focus for completing M1.3.
- Continued work on initial frontend interface components (M1.4).
