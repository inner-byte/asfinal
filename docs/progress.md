- Chose multer for handling file uploads with 4GB file size limit
- Implemented temporary file storage with cleanup to handle large uploads efficiently
- Created modern UI following the "lipsync-2" design with custom animations and gradient elements
- Used Inter and Poppins fonts as specified in the project goals
- Organized components using feature-based architecture for better maintainability
- **Added Vertex AI integration with proper type safety and validation**
- **Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff for reliable API calls**
- **Added validation for VTT format to ensure properly formatted subtitles**

### Next Steps
