# Project Roadmap and Milestones

## Introduction

This roadmap provides a structured plan for developing the AI-powered subtitle generator web application. It is divided into phases, each with specific milestones, deliverables, and timelines. The roadmap ensures that the project progresses efficiently, meeting both functional and non-functional requirements while allowing for future scalability. The development process will follow an iterative approach, with regular testing and feedback loops to maintain quality and alignment with project goals.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Development

**Objective**: Establish the foundational infrastructure and develop core components for video upload, storage, and basic subtitle generation.

**Milestones**:
- **M1.1**: Set up the development environment with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, and Appwrite integration.
- **M1.2**: Implement video upload functionality with Appwrite Bucket Storage.
- **M1.3**: Integrate the Gemini-flash-2.0 model via the Vertex API for basic subtitle generation (VTT format).
- **M1.4**: Develop the initial frontend interface for video upload and subtitle preview using Plyr.

**Deliverables**:
- Configured project repository with version control (GitHub).
- Functional video upload and storage system.
- Basic subtitle generation pipeline.
- Initial UI with video player and subtitle display.

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-4

## Phase 2: Real-time Subtitle Preview and Synchronization

**Objective**: Enhance the application with real-time subtitle preview capabilities and ensure accurate timestamp synchronization.

**Milestones**:
- **M2.1**: Implement Plyr’s `cuechange` event to monitor and adjust subtitle synchronization dynamically.
- **M2.2**: Develop backend logic for timestamp correction using FFmpeg-based alignment tools.
- **M2.3**: Optimize subtitle generation to meet the required timestamp accuracy (±0.1 to ±3 seconds).
- **M2.4**: Conduct initial testing to validate synchronization and accuracy.

**Deliverables**:
- Real-time subtitle preview feature.
- Timestamp correction mechanism.
- Test reports on subtitle accuracy and synchronization.

**Timeline**: Weeks 5-8

## Phase 3: Subtitle Export and Format Conversion

**Objective**: Enable users to export subtitles in multiple formats (SRT, VTT, ASS) with on-demand conversion.

**Milestones**:
- **M3.1**: Implement conversion tools (e.g., FFmpeg or custom scripts) for VTT to SRT, ASS, and other formats.
- **M3.2**: Develop the export functionality in the frontend, allowing users to select and download the desired format.
- **M3.3**: Ensure that conversion is performed only on export, optimizing resource usage.

**Deliverables**:
- Subtitle export feature with format selection.
- Conversion tools integrated into the backend.
- User guide on export options.

**Timeline**: Weeks 9-10

## Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancement and Optimization

**Objective**: Refine the user interface and experience, ensuring a modern, intuitive design and optimal performance.

**Milestones**:
- **M4.1**: Modernize the UI based on the "lipsync-2" design, incorporating dark gray base, gradient accents, and improved typography.
- **M4.2**: Add interactive elements such as animated transitions, glowing drop zones, and progress indicators.
- **M4.3**: Optimize frontend performance for handling large video files and real-time subtitle updates.
- **M4.4**: Conduct usability testing and gather feedback for further refinements.

**Deliverables**:
- Updated UI/UX design.
- Performance-optimized frontend.
- Usability test results and feedback summary.

 hardcoded **Timeline**: Weeks 11-12

## Phase 5: Backend Optimization and Redis Integration

**Objective**: Enhance backend performance to handle large video processing tasks efficiently using Redis for task management.

**Milestones**:
- **M5.1**: Integrate Redis for queue management and optimization of video processing tasks.
- **M5.2**: Implement worker threads or a queue system to manage concurrent processing of large videos (up to 4GB).
- **M5.3**: Test and validate backend performance under load conditions.

**Deliverables**:
- Redis-integrated task management system.
- Optimized backend processing pipeline.
- Performance test reports.

**Timeline**: Weeks 13-14

## Phase 6: Testing, Bug Fixing, and Deployment Preparation

**Objective**: Conduct comprehensive testing, address any issues, and prepare the application for deployment.

**Milestones**:
- **M6.1**: Perform end-to-end testing, including functional, performance, and usability tests.
- **M6.2**: Identify and resolve bugs and performance bottlenecks.
- **M6.3**: Prepare deployment scripts and documentation for GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

**Deliverables**:
- Test cases and results.
- Bug fix reports.
- Deployment documentation.

**Timeline**: Weeks 15-16

## Phase 7: Deployment and Monitoring

**Objective**: Deploy the application to the production environment and set up monitoring for ongoing maintenance.

**Milestones**:
- **M7.1**: Deploy the application using GitHub Actions to the production server.
- **M7.2**: Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and user interactions.
- **M7.3**: Conduct a final review and gather initial user feedback.

**Deliverables**:
- Deployed application.
- Monitoring dashboard.
- Initial user feedback summary.

**Timeline**: Week 17

## Future Phase: Live Subtitle Generation

**Objective**: Extend the application to support real-time live subtitle generation using the Gemini Live API.

**Milestones**:
- **M8.1**: Integrate the Gemini Live API for real-time audio transcription.
- **M8.2**: Implement WebSocket communication for live subtitle updates.
- **M8.3**: Enhance the frontend to display live subtitles dynamically.

**Deliverables**:
